# Down to Lunch - Swipe Right to Lunch

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the readme for Down to Lunch, the app I started whipping up because, well, eating alone in a new city is a total bummer. It's all about swiping right when you're feeling peckish and linking up with others who are also on the hunt for some lunchtime company. Pretty cool, right?

## What's Cooking?

So, here's the deal: Down to Lunch is still a bit half-baked. Got the idea while roaming around a new city, feeling a tad lonely with my sandwich. Thought it'd be awesome to have an app to find fellow lunch loners.

But, plot twist: didn't quite get it done on the road. So, it's on a little break â€” like a TV show hiatus, but without the cliffhanger. Will pick it back up when the vibe's right and I'm feeling the coding mojo again.

## The Tech in the Kitchen

### The Frontend

- **Swift**: Going full Swift for this baby. It's slick, it's fast, and it makes the whole swiping and dining thing a smooth ride.

## Planned Bites

1. **Swipe & Dine**: See someone you'd like to grab a bite with? Just swipe right and start planning that lunch date.
2. **Local Flavor**: The app's all about finding folks nearby. So if you're in the mood for tacos and someone two blocks away is too, bam, it's a match.
3. **Chit-Chat**: Hit it off with a swipe? The app's got chatting covered so you can iron out those lunch deets.
